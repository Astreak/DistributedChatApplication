# Algochat - Scalable Chat Microservice Application

Algochat is a scalable chat microservice application designed to handle millions of users while ensuring stateless consistency, availability, and fault tolerance. It utilizes various technologies including TypeScript, Express.js, Node.js, React.js, Redis PUB/SUB model, Kafka streaming, MongoDB for chat persistence, and PostgreSQL for storing user data.

## Features

- **Scalability**: Algochat has been tested to handle up to 2 million users, ensuring smooth performance even under high loads.
- **Stateless Consistency**: The application maintains consistency across its stateless architecture, ensuring reliability and ease of maintenance.
- **Availability**: With fault-tolerant design principles, Algochat ensures high availability, minimizing downtime and ensuring users can access the service when needed.
- **Technologies Used**: Algochat leverages a stack of modern technologies including TypeScript, Express.js, Node.js, React.js, Redis PUB/SUB model, Kafka streaming, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that helps in writing scalable and maintainable code.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which enables building scalable network applications.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling the creation of interactive UIs with ease.
- **Redis PUB/SUB Model**: Redis is used as a message broker with a publish/subscribe model for real-time communication between services.
- **Kafka Streaming**: Kafka is used for building real-time streaming data pipelines and applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for chat persistence, providing flexibility and scalability for storing chat data.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database used for storing user data with robust features and reliability.

## OnGoing..
